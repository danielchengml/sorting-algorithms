# Sorting Algorithms

This project aims to curate popular sorting algorithms used to sort datasets.

## Requirements:

- Computer to run the code

To run the code, simply copy and paste the code into any console that runs Javascript. I would recommend using Google Chrome.

### Bubble Sort

Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. _(Wikipedia)_

The Bubble Sort example can be found in `BubbleSort.js`.

### Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

The Insertion Sort example can be found in `InsertionSort.js`.

### Selection Sort

The selection sort is a combination of searching and sorting. During each pass, the unsorted element with the smallest (or largest) value is moved to its proper position in the array. The number of times the sort passes through the array is one less than the number of items in the array. _(Mathbit.com_

The Selection Sort example can be found in `SelectionSort.js`.

### Quick Sort

Quicksort (sometimes called partition-exchange sort) is an efficient sorting algorithm, serving as a systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order. Developed by Tony Hoare in 1959 and published in 1961, it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. _(Wikipedia)_

This method is a recursive algorithm using a "divide and conquer" strategy.

The Quick Sort example can be found in `QuickSort.js`.
